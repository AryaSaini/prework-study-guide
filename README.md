# Prework Study Guide 

## Description
My motivation to completeing this project was to get a basic understaning of how to code. I built this project to start practicing and understanding my coding skills. This website helps me study what I've learned in the prework, as well as a place for me to go if I ever need further understanding. I learned what HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are and how they are integrated to create a website.
